# User Stories for the Data Institute
## Introduction
While not all folks like Agile SDLC and Agile is not that appropriate to Data Science projects, user stories could provide a "soft" set of user requirements appropriate to a project like this.
## Data Institute User Stories
1. As a data scientist I want access to raw data sets to analyze so that I can create useful analyses and models
2. As a data manager I want to have database instances I can load data sets into for processing and querying
3. As a user of the Data Institute I want to be able to "checkout" (not checkout in the version control sense) data sets from the "library" so I can work on them
4. As a user of the Data Institute I want to be able to find a guide to the data sets available in the "library"
5. As a user of the Data Institute I would like to know what other users are so that I can collaborate and avoid "collisions"
6. As a user of the Data Institute I want to have a version management system to help structure development activities
7. As a data scientist I would like access to spatially aware database (POSTGIS) so that I can do spatial computation over my data scientist
8. As a community member I would like support and guidance on how to take advantage of data institute and its data
