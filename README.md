# Asheville Community Data Library
The Asheville Community Data Library is an experiment in human-data relationships. The main goal is to provide a virtual location for access and act as a knowledge repository for various data sources. This library is created for community members and community groups in Asheville. The scope of the project is limited to providing the means of access to the data and materials for people to understand the data to know its uses and limitations. The intended effect of this experiment is to easy the access of data for the Asheville community and have them make the appropriate actions because of what they have learned from the data.
