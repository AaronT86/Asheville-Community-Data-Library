## Census
The census is a full data count on US population every decade.

## The American Community Survey 
The American Community Survey is an on-going survey of American individuas and households.

# Important Concepts

- Area.  This data is presented at various levels including State, County, Zip Code Tabulation Area (a census semi-match to zip codes), and Census Block.

- Missing data: Sometimes the data contains missing values. This typically occurs when the sample size for that given area is too small to retain anonymity.  

- 1-year and 5-year.  The one year is only covers data for that specified year. The five year is a rolling average. The one year survey is better to use when the most recent data is needed or to see quickly changing areas.  The five year survey is better for more stable estimates and a fuller dataset.

- Race and Ethnicity.  The census has this breakout for race: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.  The two categories for the ethnicity breakout are Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino.  There is no default setting to have all the categories together.

- Universes. The American Community Survey has several universes. For employment data, only people ages 16 and older are surveyed.  For education data, only people 25 and older are surveyed.  This can change results when dealing with proportions if the full population is counted or just the people in these universes.

- Estimates. The American Community Survey provides error bounds for the estimates. These have to be used to determine differences between areas and overtime.  These might be preferred to the estimates when potential maximums and minimums are wanted.
